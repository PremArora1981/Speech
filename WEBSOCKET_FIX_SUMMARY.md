# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing WebSocket Libraries
**Problem**: Uvicorn couldn't handle WebSocket connections because `websockets` and `wsproto` packages weren't installed in the virtual environment.

**Fix**:
- Installed `websockets>=15.0.0` and `wsproto>=1.2.0` in the venv
- Added them to `requirements.txt` for future installations

**Command**:
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install websockets wsproto
```

---

### 2. ✅ Redis Package Missing in Virtual Environment
**Problem**: The LLM cache was trying to use Redis but the `redis` package wasn't installed in the venv, causing 500 errors on WebSocket connections.

**Error**: `RuntimeError: redis package must be installed for Redis caching support`

**Fix**:
- Installed `redis>=5.0.0` in the virtual environment
- Updated `backend/utils/cache.py` to use modern `from redis import asyncio as aioredis`
- Replaced incompatible `aioredis` package with `redis` package (Python 3.12 compatible)

**Commands**:
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install redis>=5.0.0
```

---

### 3. ✅ Logging Configuration Error
**Problem**: Logger was trying to format a `request_id` field that wasn't always present in log records.

**Error**: `ValueError: Formatting field not found in record: 'request_id'`

**Fix**:
- Modified `backend/utils/logging.py` to remove `request_id` from the default format string
- Changed format from `"%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(request_id)s %(message)s"` to `"%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(message)s"`

---

### 4. ✅ WebSocket Middleware Blocking
**Problem**: The `RateLimitMiddleware` was trying to process WebSocket upgrade requests as regular HTTP requests, causing them to fail.

**Fix**:
- Added WebSocket detection in `backend/api/middleware.py`:
```python
# Skip WebSocket upgrade requests
if request.headers.get("upgrade") == "websocket":
    return await call_next(request)
```

---

### 5. ✅ CORS Policy Blocking Frontend
**Problem**: Requests from `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server) were blocked by CORS policy.

**Error**: `Access to XMLHttpRequest has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present`

**Fix**:
- Updated `backend/main.py` CORS configuration to explicitly allow:
  - `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)
  - `http://localhost:3000` (Docker frontend)
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
  - `*` (wildcard for development)

---

### 6. ✅ Rate Limiting Too Strict
**Problem**: Rate limiter was blocking legitimate requests during development, causing 429 errors.

**Error**: `429 Too Many Requests` on cost tracking and telephony endpoints

**Fix**:
- Relaxed rate limits in `backend/api/middleware.py` for development:

**Before**:
```python
requests_per_minute=60
requests_per_hour=1000
burst_size=10
```

**After**:
```python
# Default endpoints
requests_per_minute=300  # 5x increase
requests_per_hour=10000  # 10x increase
burst_size=50           # 5x increase

# WebSocket endpoints
requests_per_minute=500
requests_per_hour=10000
burst_size=100

# Strict endpoints (telephony, RAG ingestion)
requests_per_minute=50  # 2.5x increase
requests_per_hour=500   # 5x increase
burst_size=10           # 2x increase
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Backend Server
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **Health**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health ✅
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs ✅
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice-session ✅

### ✅ Frontend
- **URL**: http://localhost:5173 (Vite dev server)
- **WebSocket Connection**: ✅ Working
- **API Requests**: ✅ CORS enabled
- **Rate Limiting**: ✅ Relaxed for development

---

## Testing

### Test WebSocket Connection
Open your browser to http://localhost:5173 and check the browser console. You should now see:
- No CORS errors
- No 429 rate limit errors
- WebSocket connection successful

### Test Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

### Test API Endpoint (with auth)
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: dev_api_key_12345" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

## Files Modified

1. `requirements.txt` - Added websockets, wsproto, updated aioredis→redis
2. `backend/utils/cache.py` - Updated import for modern redis package
3. `backend/utils/logging.py` - Removed request_id from default format
4. `backend/api/middleware.py` - Added WebSocket detection, relaxed rate limits
5. `backend/main.py` - Updated CORS configuration
6. `backend/services/llm_service.py` - Fixed variable name typo

---

## Production Notes

⚠️ **Before deploying to production**, consider:

1. **CORS**: Remove the wildcard `*` and use specific frontend domains
2. **Rate Limiting**: Tighten limits based on your expected traffic
3. **Redis**: Set up a proper Redis instance (not required but recommended for caching)
4. **API Keys**: Change from `dev_api_key_12345` to secure production keys
5. **Environment Variables**: Set all required API keys (SARVAM_API_KEY, etc.)

---

## Running the Application

### Start Backend (in virtual environment)
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Access the Application
Open your browser to: **http://localhost:5173**

---

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Still Failing?
1. Check that backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`
2. Check browser console for specific errors
3. Verify API key matches: `dev_api_key_12345`
4. Check that websockets package is installed in venv

### CORS Errors?
1. Ensure frontend is running on port 5173
2. Check backend logs for CORS-related errors
3. Verify CORS middleware is configured in `backend/main.py`

### Rate Limit 429 Errors?
1. The limits have been significantly relaxed for development
2. If still seeing errors, check `backend/api/middleware.py` and increase further
3. Consider excluding specific paths from rate limiting

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend and frontend are now running and connected
2. Test the voice chat interface
3. Configure your API keys in `.env` file for full functionality
4. Optional: Set up Redis for caching (not required but recommended)
5. Optional: Set up PostgreSQL for persistent storage (defaults to SQLite)
